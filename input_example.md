Standard Privacy and Security: AI systems often process vast amounts of data, amplifying existing concerns about data privacy and cybersecurity.6 Standard security practices like encryption, access control, data classification, threat monitoring, and anonymization are prerequisites for safe AI deployment.7 While foundational, these standard practices are distinct from the novel safety strategies needed to address risks like model misalignment or capability misuse, although robust security is vital for measures like protecting model weights.
