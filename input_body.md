# **Chapter 3: Strategies**

# **Introduction**

This chapter explores the diverse landscape of strategies proposed and employed to mitigate the risks associated with AI. Building upon the discussion of potential risks outlined in Chapter 2, the focus here shifts towards solutions and preventative measures. As AI capabilities continue their rapid advance, the strategies designed to ensure safety must also evolve, encompassing technical approaches, governance frameworks, and organizational practices. The aim is to provide a structured overview of current thinking and ongoing work in AI safety strategy, acknowledging both established methods and emerging research directions.

## **Chapter Structure Overview**

This chapter proceeds by first examining the inherent difficulties in ensuring AI safety (Section 2), followed by a clarification of key definitions like "alignment" (Section 3). It then explores strategies aimed at preventing the misuse of current and near-term AI systems (Section 4). Subsequently, it delves into the complex challenges and proposed solutions for ensuring the safety of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) (Section 5) and the even more speculative domain of Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) safety (Section 6). Systemic approaches, encompassing governance, organizational practices, and safety culture, are discussed in Section 7. Finally, the chapter offers practical advice and points towards future research directions (Section 8), followed by a concluding summary (Section 9). An appendix lists related comprehensive documents (Section 10).

## **Beyond the Scope of This Chapter**

While this chapter focuses on strategies directly related to preventing large-scale negative outcomes from AI misuse, misalignment, or uncontrolled development, several related topics are necessarily placed beyond its primary scope to maintain clarity and focus. Several issues are treated as distinct domains and are not the central focus here:

  - **AI-Generated Misinformation:** The proliferation of AI-driven misinformation, including deepfakes and biased content generation. Strategies to combat this, such as robust detection systems, watermarking, and responsible AI principles, are beyond the score of the chapter. These often fall under the umbrella of content moderation, media literacy, and platform governance, distinct from the core technical alignment and control strategies discussed in this chapter.
  - **Standard Privacy and Security:** AI systems often process vast amounts of data, amplifying existing concerns about data privacy and cybersecurity.X6 Standard security practices like encryption, access control, data classification, threat monitoring, and anonymization are prerequisites for safe AI deployment.X7 While foundational, these standard practices are distinct from the novel safety strategies needed to address risks like model misalignment or capability misuse, although robust security is vital for measures like protecting model weights.
  - **Discrimination and Toxicity:** While biased or toxic outputs constitute a safety concern, this chapter concentrates on strategies aimed at preventing catastrophic failures or misuse stemming from advanced capabilities or goal misalignment, rather than the pervasive issue of bias itself.
  - **Negative Externalities (Socioeconomic, Environmental):** The development and deployment of AI have significant externalities, including potential job displacement X16, increased economic inequality X17, substantial energy and water consumption by data centers X18, reliance on unsustainably mined minerals X18, and a considerable carbon footprint.X19 These raise concerns about digital colonialism and sustainability.X19 While critical for overall societal well-being and requiring governance solutions X21, these externalities are generally considered distinct from the technical safety challenges of controlling advanced AI behavior, and while summarily treated in the systemic risks section, won’t be really detailed.
  - **AI Welfare and Rights:** As AI systems become more sophisticated, questions arise about their potential for sentience and the ethical considerations regarding their treatment.X15 This is a distinct ethical domain concerning our obligations *to* AI, rather than ensuring safety *from* AI.
  - **Devaluation of Human Effort:** The potential for AI to diminish the perceived value of human creativity and labor is a significant socioeconomic and psychological concern X14, but not a direct technical safety strategy.
  - **Errors due to lack of Capability:** While AI system failures due to lack of capability or capability or robustness are a source of risk X38, the strategies discussed in this chapter are aimed at *mitigating* risks arising from *both* insufficient robustness *and* potentially high (but misaligned or misused) capabilities. And the solutions to this type of risk are the same as for other industries: testing, iteration, and making the system more capable.

The scope chosen here reflects a common focus within certain parts of the AI safety community on existential or large-scale catastrophic risks arising from powerful, potentially agentic AI systems.

A common distinction is made between near-term AI safety concerns (often related to current systems, addressing issues like bias, fairness, privacy, transparency, and immediate misuse) and long-term or existential safety concerns (focused on risks from future, highly capable AGI or ASI, such as loss of control or catastrophic misalignment).X75 This chapter primarily focuses on strategies relevant to the latter, though the boundary can be blurry.

# **AI Safety is Challenging**

Developing strategies to ensure the safety of increasingly capable AI systems presents unique and significant challenges. These difficulties stem from the nature of AI itself, the current state of the research field, and the complexity of the risks involved.

\!\!\! quote  "Anthropic, 2023 ([Anthropic, 2023](https://www.anthropic.com/news/core-views-on-ai-safety))"

\<tab\>

We do not know how to train systems to robustly behave well.

\</tab\>

## **The Nature of the Problem**

Several intrinsic properties make AI safety a particularly hard problem :

**AI risk is an emerging problem that is still poorly understood.** AI risk is a relatively new field dealing with rapidly evolving technology. Our understanding of the full spectrum of potential failure modes and long-term consequences is incomplete. Devising robust safeguards for technologies that do not yet exist, but which could have profoundly negative outcomes, is inherently difficult.

\*\*The field is still pre-paradigmatic.\*\*There is currently no single, universally accepted paradigm for AI safety. Researchers disagree on fundamental aspects, including the most likely threat models (e.g., sudden takeover ([Yudkowsky, 2022](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/uMQ3cqWDPHhjtiesc/agi-ruin-a-list-of-lethalities)), vs. gradual loss of control ([Critch, 2021](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/LpM3EAakwYdS6aRKf/what-multipolar-failure-looks-like-and-robust-agent-agnostic))), and the most promising solution paths.  The research agendas of some researchers seem scarcely useful to others, and one of the favorite activities of alignment researchers is to criticize each other constructively.

**AIs are black boxes that are trained, not built.** Modern deep learning models are "black boxes." While we know how to train them, the specific algorithms they learn and their internal decision-making processes remain largely opaque. These models lack the modularity common in traditional software engineering, making it difficult to decompose, analyze, or verify their behavior. Progress in interpretability has yet to fully overcome this challenge.

**Complexity is the source of many blind spots.** The sheer complexity of large AI models means that unexpected and potentially harmful behaviors can emerge without warning. Issues like "glitch tokens", e.g., "SolidGoldMagikarp" causing erratic behavior in GPT models ([Rumbelow & Watkins, 2023](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/aPeJE8bSo6rAFoLqg/solidgoldmagikarp-plus-prompt-generation)),  demonstrate how unforeseen interactions between components (like tokenizers and training data) can lead to failures. When GPT encounters[^1] this infrequent word, it behaves unpredictably and erratically. This phenomenon occurs because GPT uses a tokenizer to break down sentences into tokens (sets of letters such as words or combinations of letters and numbers), and the token "SolidGoldMagikarp" was present in the tokenizer's dataset but not in the GPT model's dataset. This blind spot is not an isolated incident.

**Creating an exhaustive risk framework is difficult.** There are many, many different classifications of risk scenarios that focus on various types of harm ([Critch & Russel, 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06924); [Hendrycks et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12001)). Proposing a solid single-risk model beyond criticism is extremely difficult, and the risk scenarios often contain a degree of vagueness. No scenario captures most of the probability mass, and there is a wide diversity of potentially catastrophic scenarios ([Pace, 2020](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6jkGf5WEKMpMFXZp2/what-failure-looks-like-distilling-the-discussion)).

**Some arguments that seem initially appealing may be misleading.** For example, the principal author of the paper ([Turner et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01683)) presenting a mathematical result on instrumental convergence, Alex Turner, now believes his theorem is a poor way to think about the problem ([Turner, 2023](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dqSwccGTWyBgxrR58/turntrout-s-shortform-feed?commentId=Sw89AxHGJ5j7E7ETf)). Some other classical arguments have been criticized recently, like the counting argument or the utility maximization frameworks, which will be discussed in chapter “Goal Misgeneralization”([AI Optimists, 2023](https://optimists.ai/2023/11/28/ai-is-easy-to-control/)).

**Many essential terms in AI safety are complicated to define.** They ofen require knowledge in philosophy (epistemology, theory of mind), and AI. For instance, to determine if an AI is an agent, one must clarify “what does agency mean?" which, as we'll see in later chapters, requires nuance and may be an intrinsically ill-defined and fuzzy term. Some topics in AI safety are so challenging to grasp and are thought to be non-scientific in the machine learning (ML) community, such as discussing situational awareness ([Hinton, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1TEjTeQeg0)) or why AI might be able to “really understand”. These concepts are far from consensus among philosophers and AI researchers and require a lot of caution.

**A simple solution probably doesn’t exist.** For instance, the response to climate change is not just one measure, like saving electricity in winter at home. A whole range of potentially different solutions must be applied. Just as there are various problems to consider when building an airplane, similarly, when training and deploying an AI, a range of issues could arise, requiring precautions and various security measures.

**AI Safety is hard to measure.** Working on the problem can lead to an illusion of understanding, thereby creating the illusion of control. AI safety lacks clear feedback loops. Progress in AI capability advancement is relatively easy to measure and benchmark, while progress in safety is comparatively harder to measure. For example, it’s much easier to monitor the inference speed than monitoring the truthfulness of a system or monitoring its safety properties.

## **Disagreement and Disensus**

The pre-paradigmatic nature of AI safety leads to significant disagreements among experts. These differences in perspective are crucial to understand when evaluating proposed strategies.

**The consequences of failures in AI alignment are steeped in uncertainty.** New insights could challenge many high-level considerations discussed in this textbook. For instance, Zvi Mowshowitz has compiled a list of critical questions marked by significant uncertainty and strong disagreements both ethical and technical ([Mowshowitz, 2023](https://thezvi.substack.com/p/the-crux-list)). For example, what worlds count as catastrophic versus non-catastrophic? What would count as a non-catastrophic outcome? What is valuable? What do we care about? ([Mowshowitz, 2023](https://thezvi.substack.com/p/the-crux-list)) If answered differently, these questions could significantly alter one's estimate of the likelihood and severity of catastrophes stemming from unaligned AGI.

**Divergent Worldviews:** These disagreements often stem from fundamentally different worldviews. Some experts, like Robin Hanson, may approach AI risk through economic or evolutionary lenses, potentially leading to different conclusions about takeoff speeds and the likelihood of stable control compared to those focusing on agent foundations or technical alignment failures ([Hanson, 2023](https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/ai-risk-again)). Others, like Richard Sutton, have expressed views suggesting an acceptance or even embrace of AI potentially succeeding humanity, framing it as a natural evolutionary step rather than an existential catastrophe ([Sutton, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgHFMolXs3U)). These differing philosophical stances influence strategic priorities.

## **The Problem of Safetywashing**

The combination of high stakes, public concern, and lack of consensus creates fertile ground for "safetywashing"—the practice of misleadingly portraying AI products, research, or practices as safer or more aligned with safety goals than they actually are ([Vaintrob, 2023](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PY3HEHc5fMQkTrQo4/beware-safety-washing)).

**Safetywashing can create a false sense of security.** Companies developing powerful AI face incentives to appear safety-conscious to appease the public, regulators, and potential employees. Safetywashing can involve overstating the safety benefits of certain features, focusing on less critical aspects of safety (like near-term issues) while downplaying existential risks, or funding/conducting research that primarily advances capabilities under the guise of safety. This can lead to insufficient risk mitigation efforts.X55 It can misdirect funding and talent towards less impactful work and make it harder to build genuine scientific consensus on the true state of AI safety.X55

**Assessing progress in safety is tricky.** Even with the intention to help, actions might have a net negative impact (e.g. from second order effects, like accelerating deployment of dangerous technologies), and determining the contribution's impact is far from trivial. For example, the impact of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), currently used to instruction-tune and make ChatGPT safer, is still debated in the community ([Christiano, 2023](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/vwu4kegAEZTBtpT6p/thoughts-on-the-impact-of-rlhf-research)). One reason the impact of RLHF may be negative is that this technique may create an illusion of alignment that would make spotting deceptive alignment even more challenging. The alignment of the systems trained through RLHF is shallow ([Casper et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15217)), and the alignment properties might break with future more situationally aware models. Similarly, certain interpretability work faces dual-use concerns.X61 Some argue that much current "AI safety" research solves easy problems that primarily benefit developers economically, potentially speeding up capabilities rather than meaningfully reducing existential risk.X62  As a consequence, even well-intentioned research might inadvertently accelerate risks.

# **Definitions**

**The Importance of Clear Terminology.** In a field as nascent and contested as AI safety, establishing clear and commonly understood terminology is crucial yet challenging. Ambiguity can lead to miscommunication, hinder collaboration, obscure disagreements, and facilitate safetywashing.X55 Terms like "alignment" and "safety" are used with varying meanings, reflecting different underlying assumptions about the nature of the problem and the goals of the research. This section aims to clarify some common uses and distinctions, drawing primarily from discussions within the AI safety research community.

## **Defining AI Alignment**

"AI alignment" generally refers to the goal of ensuring AI systems act in ways that are consistent with human intentions or values. However, the precise scope of this goal is debated.

**Some definitions of alignment are very broad.** Some use "alignment" broadly to encompass the entire challenge of ensuring advanced AI leads to beneficial outcomes.X70 This might include ensuring AI systems understand and share human preferences or ethical values X70, which involves tackling complex problems in value learning and moral philosophy.X71 It could also cover aspects of robustness and reliability, .i.e, making sure that the AI is not jailbreakable.X72

**Some definitions are much more narrow (Intent Alignment):** Paul Christiano proposed a narrower definition focusing specifically on the AI's *intent*: "A is trying to do what H wants it to do," where A is the AI and H is the human operator.X70 This definition emphasizes the AI's motivation rather than its competence or knowledge. An intent-aligned AI might still fail due to misunderstanding the operator's wishes or lacking knowledge about the world, but it is fundamentally *trying* to be helpful.X73 This is often described as a *de dicto* interpretation – the AI tries to do what it *believes* the human wants, even if that belief is mistaken.X73 Proponents argue this isolates a core technical challenge distinct from broader issues like value clarification or capability robustness.X73

**Limitations:**

  - **Conceptual Challenges:** Applying concepts like "trying," "wanting," or "intent" to AI systems is non-trivial and depends on how one conceptualizes AI cognition.X73 Equating intent with the optimization objective used during training is likely insufficient, as illustrated by the divergence between evolutionary fitness (optimization objective) and human goals (emergent motivation).X73
  - **Alignment to what or who?** A key ambiguity is *who* or *what* the AI should be aligned *to*. Is it the immediate operator X70, the system designer X75, a specific group, humanity as a whole X76, objective ethical principles X77, or the operator's hypothetical informed preferences (Coherent Extrapolated Volition - CEV)?

        - [**https://x.com/michael\_nielsen/status/1911863922090758635**](https://x.com/michael_nielsen/status/1911863922090758635)

## **Defining AI Safety**

"AI safety" is often used as a broader term than alignment. While alignment focuses on the AI's goals and intentions, safety encompasses a wider range of concerns about preventing harm from AI systems.

**AI safety** is concerned with ensuring that AI systems do not inadvertently or deliberately cause harm or danger to humans or the environment. AI safety research aims to identify causes of unintended AI behavior and develop tools for safe and reliable operation.X79 It can include technical subfields like robustness (ensuring reliable performance, including against adversarial attacks), monitoring (observing AI behavior), and capability control (limiting potentially dangerous abilities).X77

\*\*Alignment is generally considered a subfield of AI safety.\*\*X77 Achieving alignment (especially intent alignment) is seen by many as necessary, though perhaps not sufficient, for ensuring the safety of highly capable AI systems. However, some safety strategies (like certain control mechanisms) might aim to ensure safety even if alignment fails.X75

## **Defining AI Ethics and AI Control**

**AI ethics** is the field that examines the moral principles and societal implications of AI systems, focusing on how these technologies should align with and respect fundamental human values. It addresses the ethical considerations of AI rights, the potential societal upheavals resulting from AI advancements, and the moral frameworks necessary to navigate these changes. The core of AI ethics lies in ensuring that AI developments are aligned with human dignity, fairness, and societal well-being, through a deep understanding of their broader societal impact. This chapter is mostly not focusing on AI ethics.

**AI control** is about the mechanisms that can be put in place to manage and restrain an AI system if it acts contrary to human interests. Control might require physical or virtual constraints, monitoring systems, or even a kill switch to shut down the AI if necessary ([Greenblatt et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06942)). In essence, alignment seeks to prevent preference divergence by design, while control deals with the consequences of potential divergence after the fact ([Christiano, 2018](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/ZeE7EKHTFMBs8eMxn/clarifying-ai-alignment)). The distinction is important because some approaches to the AI safety problem focus on building aligned AI that inherently does the right thing, while others focus on finding ways to control AI that might have other goals. For example, a research agenda from the research organization Redwood Research argues that even if alignment is necessary for superintelligence-level AIs, control through some form of monitoring may be a working strategy for AIs in the human regime ([Greenblatt et al., 2024](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/kcKrE9mzEHrdqtDpE/the-case-for-ensuring-that-powerful-ais-are-controlled)).

Ideally, an AGI would be aligned and controllable, meaning it would have the right goals and be subject to human oversight and intervention if something goes wrong.

## **Limitations and Nuances**

It is crucial to recognize that these definitions are not universally agreed upon and are subject to ongoing debate and refinement.X75 The choice of definition often reflects underlying assumptions about the nature of AI risk and the most promising paths forward.X75 For instance, focusing narrowly on intent alignment prioritizes research on inner/outer alignment problems X70, whereas a broader view might incorporate value learning or robustness research more centrally. The ambiguity surrounding the "alignment target" X76 remains a fundamental challenge for both technical specification and ethical justification. As the field matures, greater terminological clarity will be essential for productive research and effective governance.

# **Preventing Misuse**

A significant category of AI risk involves the intentional use of AI systems by humans to cause harm, often referred to as "misuse".X8 This contrasts with alignment failures, where the AI system itself behaves undesirably due to flawed goals or learning processes. Misuse risks are particularly relevant for currently available and near-term AI systems, as their capabilities can be leveraged by malicious actors for various harmful purposes, such as generating disinformation X1, facilitating cybercrime X83, or potentially lowering barriers to creating biological or chemical weapons.X83 Strategies to prevent misuse often focus on controlling access to dangerous capabilities or implementing technical safeguards to limit harmful applications.

## **Strategy A: Monitored APIs and Access Control Strategies**

One prominent approach to mitigating misuse involves developers retaining control over how their models are accessed and used, typically by deploying them via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) rather than releasing the model weights openly.

[](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdvKtkuJirGcs-oGCL132v4O400fx6boKbc1hMbHvShKKUIjUhWS4-1slF62N2V3BKOjeT34SX0IyGJrcLkgBgKH8hsZ6JrTF4LZQ6_tt6l19-h-virLBVnSRO0q3LlHykLyBe2?key=ii_Tx8rTP8MI8IGRzgDFwL-E)

\<caption\>

This schema illustrates how an API works. This diagram is very simplified and is for illustration purposes only. OpenAI's API does not work like this.

\</caption\>

### **Fundamentals of Access Control Strategies**

**API-Based Safeguards enable many mitigation measures.** Deploying models via APIs allows developers to implement various server-side controls. These can include:

  - *Input/Output Filtering:* Implementing filters to detect and block prompts requesting harmful content or outputs containing harmful information (e.g., hate speech, illegal instructions).X84
  - *Usage Monitoring:* Tracking user activity to identify suspicious patterns indicative of misuse, potentially leading to warnings or account suspension.X84
  - *Authentication/Authorization:* Requiring user authentication allows for accountability and the ability to revoke access for policy violations.X85

**A key monitoring strategy is the Know Your Customer (KYC) standard.** This is a mandatory process adopted by companies like banks that involves verifying the identities of their clients or legal entities in line with current customer due diligence regulations. KYC concretely means requiring an identity card plus a background check before any services can be used. This is important for tracing malicious users.

**Dangerous models should not be hacked and exfiltrated.** Research labs developing cutting-edge models must implement rigorous cybersecurity measures to protect AI systems against theft by outside actors and use sufficient cybersecurity defenses to limit proliferation. This seems simple, but it's not, and protecting models from nation-state actors could require extraordinary effort ([Ladish & Heim, 2022](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/2oAxpRuadyjN2ERhe/information-security-considerations-for-ai-and-the-long-term)).

[](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcCROTXwb83rs14y6p8Va19cLUnxTMXTaEd1SBLK6rVNk8ciJbrD0RY5RCs_5Kzgq6CWaEw3Iy44JqI261ldYTIyjpFmxlaIWQnNztNEpxfstQCmWGY4m_ca6_yDJTfSy3XZ6kWFA?key=ii_Tx8rTP8MI8IGRzgDFwL-E)

\<caption\>

**The Gradient of Access.** Model release exists on a spectrum, from fully closed systems accessible only internally, to staged releases, API access, downloadable weights with restrictions, and fully open-source releases. API-based deployment represents an intermediate point on this gradient.  ([Seger et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09227))

\</caption\>

### **Technical Safeguards within Models**

Beyond access control and instruction tuning techniques like RLHF, researchers are developing techniques to build safety mechanisms directly into the models themselves or their deployment pipelines.

  - **Circuit Breakers:** Inspired by representation engineering, circuit breakers aim to detect and interrupt the internal activation patterns associated with harmful outputs as they form.X86 By "rerouting" these harmful representations (e.g., using Representation Rerouting with LoRRA), this technique can prevent the generation of harmful content, demonstrating robustness against unseen adversarial attacks while potentially preserving model utility.X86 This approach targets the model's intrinsic capacity for harm, making it potentially more robust than input/output filtering. TODO: Add a diagram
  - **Machine Unlearning:** This involves techniques to selectively remove specific knowledge or capabilities from a trained model without full retraining.X87 Applications relevant to misuse prevention include removing knowledge about dangerous substances or weapons X89, erasing harmful biases, or removing jailbreak vulnerabilities.X89 Techniques range from gradient-based methods to parameter modification and model editing.X87 However, challenges remain in ensuring complete and robust forgetting, avoiding catastrophic forgetting of useful knowledge, and scaling these methods efficiently.

### **Box: The impossible challenge of creating tamper resistant safeguards**

A major challenge for open-weight models is that adversaries can fine-tune them to remove built-in safeguards.X42

**Why can't we simply instruction-tune powerful models and then release them as open weight?** Once a model is freely accessible, even if it has been fine-tuned to include security filters, removing these filters is relatively straightforward. Moreover, recent studies have shown that a few hundred euros are sufficient to bypass all safety barriers currently in place on available open-source models simply by fine-tuning the model with a few toxic examples. ([Lermen et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20624)) This is why placing models behind APIs makes sense, as it prevents unauthorized fine-tuning without the company's consent.

**Tamper-Resistant Safeguards as a research direction.** Research into tamper-resistant safeguards, such as the TAR method, aims to make safety mechanisms (like refusal or knowledge restriction) robust against such fine-tuning attacks.X42 TAR has shown promise in resisting extensive fine-tuning while preserving general capabilities, though fundamental limitations in defending against sophisticated attacks exploiting benign variations remain.X42 TODO: check this

\!\!\! quote  "Anthropic ([Anthropic, 2023](https://www-cdn.anthropic.com/1adf000c8f675958c2ee23805d91aaade1cd4613/responsible-scaling-policy.pdf))"

\<tab\>

[...] safeguards such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) or constitutional training can almost certainly be fine-tuned away within the specified 1% of training cost.

\</tab\>

### **Evaluation and Verification**

**The necessity of model evaluation.** The first step in this strategy is to identify which models are considered dangerous and which are not via model evaluation. The paper Model Evaluation for Extreme Risks ([Shevlane et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15324)) lists a few critical, dangerous capabilities that need to be assessed. Before deploying powerful models, developers (or third parties) should evaluate them for specific dangerous capabilities, such as the ability to assist in cyberattacks or bioweapon design.X96 These evaluations inform decisions about deployment and necessary safeguards.X96

**Red Teaming can help assess if the mitigations are sufficient.** During red teaming, internal teams try to exploit weaknesses in the system to improve its security. They should test whether a hypothetical malicious user can get a sufficient amount of bits of advice from the model without getting caught.

  - For more information, you can read the Evaluations Chapter.

**Box: A possible emerging challenge: Distributed Training and Governance Implications**

The rise of distributed training techniques, enabling LLMs to be trained across multiple, geographically dispersed compute clusters with low communication overhead (e.g., DiLoCo X30), presents new challenges and opportunities for misuse prevention and governance.

  - **It might be possible in the future to train and serve models in a distributed way.** Methods like DiLoCo allow training large models without massive, centralized data centers, using techniques inspired by federated learning.X127 Frameworks like OpenDiLoCo demonstrate feasibility across continents.X30
  - **Policy Implications:** Distributed training could democratize AI development by lowering infrastructure barriers.X127 However, it significantly complicates compute-based governance strategies (like KYC for compute providers or monitoring large data centers) that assume centralized training.X127 It makes tracking and controlling who is training powerful models much harder, potentially increasing proliferation risks if effective governance mechanisms are not adapted.X129

## **Strategy B: Defense Acceleration (d/acc)**

The above framework assumes that dangerous AIs are closed behind APIs and require a certain amount of centralization. An alternative or complementary approach focuses on using AI to strengthen defenses against misuse, rather than solely restricting offensive capabilities.

**Centralization can also pose systemic risks** ([Kapoor et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07918)**).** There's a trade-off between securing models behind APIs to control misuse and the risks of over-centralization ([Cihon et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.03573)). For instance, if in 20 years all companies worldwide rely on a single company's API, significant risks of value lock-in or fragility could arise because the whole world would be dependent on the political opinion of this model. The stability or instability of this API could be a single point of failure, without talking about power concentrations.

**Another possible paradigm is that AIs should be open and decentralized.** Yes, if models are open-sourced, we have to acknowledge that not all AIs will be used for good: even if AIs are instruction-tuned before open-sourcing, it's possible to remove security barriers very easily ([Lermen et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20624)), as we've seen earlier. This means that some people will misuse AI, and we need to prepare for that. For example, we would need to create more defenses in existing infrastructures. An example of defense would be to use models to iterate on all the world's open-source code to find security flaws so that good actors rather than malicious actors find security flaws. Another example would be to use the model to find holes in the security of the bioweapons supply chain and correct those problems.

**Defense acceleration.** Defense acceleration, or d/acc, is a framework popularized by Vitalik Buterin ([Buterin, 2023](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/11/27/techno_optimism.html)). d/acc is a strategic approach focusing on promoting technologies and innovations that inherently favor defense over offense. This strategy emphasizes developing and accelerating technologies that protect individuals, societies, and ecosystems from various threats rather than technologies that could be used for aggressive or harmful purposes. It's like vaccinating society against the potential downsides of our advancements. d/acc would also be a plausible strategy for maintaining freedom and privacy. It's a bit like ensuring everyone has a strong enough lock on their doors; if breaking in is tough, there's less chaos and crime. This is crucial for ensuring that technological advancements don't lead to dystopian scenarios where surveillance and control are rampant.

**A concrete example: AI for Cybersecurity Defense:** A key application is using AI to improve cybersecurity.X117 Powerful AI could potentially automate vulnerability detection, monitor systems for intrusions, manage fine-grained permissions more effectively than humans, or displace human operators from security-critical tasks.X120 While current models may not yet be reliable enough X121, the potential exists for AI to significantly bolster cyber defenses against both conventional and AI-driven attacks.X122 ([Schlegeris, 2024](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/2wxufQWK8rXcDGbyL/access-to-powerful-ai-might-make-computer-security-radically)) outlines four promising strategies for using AI to enhance security: comprehensive monitoring of human actions with AI flagging suspicious activities; trust displacement where AI handles sensitive tasks instead of humans; fine-grained permission management that would be too labor-intensive for humans; and AI-powered investigation of suspicious activities. These approaches could dramatically reduce insider threats and data exfiltration risks, potentially making computer security "radically easier" when powerful AI becomes available.

\!\!\! note "Ensuring a positive offense-defense balance in an open-source world"

\<tab\>

**A key consideration for the feasibility of the d/acc framework is the offense-defense balance: how hard is it to defend against an attacker?** This concept is crucial to assess which models are more likely to be beneficial than detrimental if we open-source them. In traditional software development, open sourcing often shifts the offense-defense balance positively: the increased transparency allows a broader community of developers to identify and patch vulnerabilities, enhancing overall security ([Seger et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09227)). However, this dynamic could change with the open-sourcing of frontier AI models because they introduce new emerging types of risks that could not simply be patched. This represents a significant shift from traditional software vulnerabilities to more complex and dangerous threats that cannot be easily countered with defensive measures.

In the case of AI, sharing the most potent models may pose extreme risks that could outweigh the usual benefits of open-sourcing. For example, just as sharing the procedure for making a deadly virus seems extremely irresponsible, so too should freely distributing AI models that provide access to such knowledge.

The current balance for sharing frontier models remains uncertain; it has been clearly positive so far, but deploying increasingly powerful models could tip this balance towards unacceptable levels of risk. [^2]

The dangers emerging from frontier AI are nascent, and the harms they pose are not yet extreme. That said, as we stand at the dawn of a new technological era with increasingly capable frontier AI, we are seeing signals of new dangerous capabilities. We must pay attention to these signals. Once more extreme harms start occurring, it might be too late to start thinking about standards and regulations to ensure safe model release.

\</tab\>

The d/acc philosophy requires more research, as it's not clear that the offense-defense balance is positive before open-sourcing dangerous AIs, as open-sourcing is irreversible.

\<tab\>

Most systems that are too dangerous to open source are probably too dangerous to be trained at all given the kind of practices that are common in labs today, where it’s very plausible they’ll leak, or very plausible they’ll be stolen, or very plausible if they’re available over an API they could cause harm.

\</tab\>

### **Case Study: Open Source vs. Closed Models**

The debate over whether to release powerful foundation models openly (making weights publicly available) or keep them closed (accessed via APIs) is central to misuse prevention strategy.

  - **Arguments for Openness:** Proponents emphasize accelerated innovation, broader access, increased transparency and auditability, and the distribution of power away from large labs.X125 Openness is seen as vital for independent safety research and development of defenses.X124 Some researchers argues that attempting to suppress open source is futile and counterproductive, as models will emerge anyway, and openness fosters societal awareness.X135
  - **Arguments for Closure (Risks of Openness):** Critics highlight the increased risk of misuse, as adversaries can easily remove safeguards, fine-tune models for harmful purposes (e.g., generating misinformation, aiding cyberattacks or bioweapon design), and exploit vulnerabilities more effectively with white-box access.X133 Open sourcing also facilitates the proliferation of models with inherent flaws (bias, security vulnerabilities) and makes it difficult to ensure safety updates are applied downstream.X133 Some argue the offense-defense balance for AI knowledge favors offense, making publication risky.X136 GovAI suggests extreme risks may outweigh benefits for highly capable models.X132
  - **Marginal Risk Assessment:** Some researchers argue that policy decisions should focus on the *marginal risk* of open models compared to closed models or existing technologies (like the internet).X137 They contend that evidence for significantly higher marginal risk from open models is currently limited for many misuse vectors (except perhaps CSAM/NCII).X138
  - **Alternative Release Strategies:** Given the tradeoffs, alternatives like staged release X140, gated access with KYC X133, research APIs X133, and trusted partnerships X133 TODO: Check are proposed to capture some benefits of openness while mitigating risks.

**Table 1: Open vs. Closed Foundation Models: A Comparative Overview**

TODO: Check

| **Feature** | **Open Models (Weights Available)** | **Closed Models (API Access)** | **Mitigation Strategies (Open)** | **Mitigation Strategies (Closed)** |

### **Case Study: Biorisks**

The potential for AI to accelerate the development or accessibility of biological weapons is a significant misuse concern.X106 AI could lower barriers for non-experts or enable the creation of novel, more dangerous pathogens.X97 To mitigate AI misuse in the development of bioweapons, a multi-pronged strategy is necessary:

Strategy A: Monitored APIs

  - **Access management** strategies can further limit misuse. Curating training data, using data use agreements, and implementing structured access with Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols can restrict access to sensitive information and tools. Strengthening nucleic acid synthesis screening and using input/output filtering can also help prevent the generation and dissemination of dangerous information.
  - Strong **cybersecurity** measures are essential to safeguard biological databases, AI model weights, and lab equipment from unauthorized access and malicious use.

Strategy B: Defense Acceleration

  - Finally, **investing in resilience** by providing public compute resources conditional on safety practices, building model-sharing infrastructure, and funding countermeasures can strengthen the overall defense against AI-enabled biothreats.

Strategy X: Organizational safety TODO: remove X, grasp

  - **Responsible development** practices should be expanded, potentially including licensing for high-risk biological design tools and increased liability for developers. These measures could be complemented by voluntary commitments and refined publication norms within the AI community.
  - The next step is a thorough **risk assessment**. This involves evaluating AI models for potentially dangerous bio-capabilities and red teaming biological design tools to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses.
  - **Transparency** is also crucial. Implementing impact statements, reporting to regulators, and establishing vulnerability reporting mechanisms can improve accountability and oversight. Additionally, watermarking biological designs could aid in tracking and identifying the origins of potentially harmful creations.

## **Strategy C: Addressing Risks from Current AIs**

The previous two strategies focus on reducing risks from models that are not yet widely available, such as models capable of advanced cyberattacks or engineering pathogens. However, what about models that enable deep fakes, misinformation campaigns, or privacy violations? Many of these models are already widely accessible.

Unfortunately, it is already too easy to use open-source models to create sexualized images of people from a few photos of them. There is no purely technical solution to counter this. For example, adding defenses (like adversarial noise) to photos published online to make them unreadable by AI will probably not scale, and empirically, every type of defense has been bypassed by attacks in the literature of adversarial attacks.

The primary solution is to regulate and establish strict norms against this type of behavior. Some potential approaches ([Control AI, 2024](https://controlai.com/deepfakes/deepfakes-policy)):

1.  **Laws and penalties:** Enact and enforce laws making it illegal to create and share non-consensual deep fake pornography or use AI for stalking, harassment, privacy violations, intellectual property or misinformation. Impose significant penalties as a deterrent.
2.  **Content moderation:** Require online platforms to proactively detect and remove AI-generated problematic content, misinformation, and privacy-violating material. Hold platforms accountable for failure to moderate.
3.  **Watermarking:** Encourage or require "watermarking" AI-generated content. Develop standards for digital provenance and authentication.
4.  **Education and awareness:** Launch public education campaigns about the risks of deep fakes, misinformation, and AI privacy threats. Teach people to be critical consumers of online content.
5.  **Research:** Support research into technical methods of detecting AI-generated content, identifying manipulated media, and preserving privacy from AI systems.

Another possibility is to accelerate the defensive deployment of AI. For instance, AI-powered systems can screen phone calls in real-time, analyzing voice patterns, call frequency, and conversational cues to identify likely scams and alert users or block calls.X145 Chatbots like Daisy X148 and services like Jolly Roger Telephone X151 employ AI to engage scammers in lengthy, unproductive conversations, wasting their time and diverting them from potential victims. These represent practical, defense-oriented applications of AI against common forms of misuse. But this is only an early step and this is far from being sufficient.

Ultimately, a combination of legal frameworks, platform policies, social norms, and technological tools will be needed to mitigate the risks posed by widely available AI models.

# **5. AGI Safety**

As artificial intelligence potentially approaches and surpasses human capabilities across a wide range of cognitive tasks—a state often termed Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)—a distinct set of safety challenges emerges. Unlike misuse, where human intent is the driver of harm, AGI safety primarily concerns the behavior of the AI system itself. The core problem becomes *alignment*: ensuring that these highly capable, potentially autonomous systems reliably understand and pursue goals consistent with human values and intentions, rather than developing and acting on misaligned objectives that could lead to catastrophic outcomes.X77 This section explores strategies aimed at tackling the AGI alignment problem.

**5.2 Requirements for an Alignment Solution**

Given the potential stakes, any proposed solution to the AGI alignment problem must meet stringent requirements. While consensus is incomplete, several desirable properties are frequently cited X153:

  - **Scalability:** The alignment method must remain effective as the AI's capabilities increase, potentially to superhuman levels. Solutions that only work for current or near-human-level AI may be insufficient.
  - **Robustness:** The solution must be reliable under diverse and novel circumstances, resisting unforeseen distributional shifts and potential adversarial pressures, including attempts by the AI itself to circumvent alignment measures.
  - **Low Alignment Tax:** The "alignment tax" refers to the costs (in terms of computational resources, research effort, development time, or performance limitations) incurred by implementing alignment measures.X74 If the tax is too high, developers might be incentivized to forgo safety measures in competitive environments.X74
  - **Feasibility:** The proposed solution must be implementable with foreseeable technology and resources. Highly theoretical solutions requiring currently non-existent capabilities are less actionable.
  - **Comprehensive:** The solution, or combination of solutions, must address the multifaceted nature of the alignment problem, including known difficulties like specification gaming, goal misgeneralization, ensuring scalable oversight, achieving interpretability, and understanding core concepts like agency and corrigibility.X153

**5.3 Naive Strategies and the Difficulty of Alignment**

Simple approaches to controlling AGI are widely considered insufficient. The argument that "AI is easy to control" because it is a "white box" whose internals are accessible X154 faces counterarguments. Critics point out the difficulty of specifying complex human values, the potential for emergent goals, the challenge of out-of-distribution generalization, and the possibility of deceptive alignment, where an AI behaves correctly during training but pursues hidden goals upon deployment.X154 The claim that alignment is easily achieved or the default state is contested within the research community. Core difficulties like specification gaming (exploiting loopholes in objectives), goal misgeneralization (failing to generalize intended goals correctly to new situations), scalable oversight (humans being unable to effectively supervise superhuman systems), and interpretability (understanding the AI's internal reasoning) remain open research problems.X153

**5.4 Solving the Alignment Problem: Core Research Directions**

Addressing the alignment challenge involves several interconnected research thrusts:

  - **Truthfulness and Honesty:** Ensuring AI systems provide accurate information and do not deceive users is a component of alignment. Research explores detecting lies by analyzing internal model activations.X155 The discovery of a "universal" 2D subspace related to truth and polarity in LLM activations offers a potential avenue for robust lie detection X155, though limitations regarding complex statements and the fundamental nature of these representations remain.X155
  - **Value Learning and Specification:** Research aims to enable AIs to learn or infer complex human values and preferences, moving beyond simple reward functions that are prone to specification gaming. (This is elaborated in the Specification chapter).
  - **Robustness and Generalization:** Work focuses on ensuring AI systems generalize their intended behavior correctly to novel situations and resist adversarial perturbations. (This is elaborated in the Generalization chapter).
  - **Scalable Oversight:** Developing methods for humans (potentially aided by AI) to reliably supervise AI systems that may vastly exceed human capabilities in speed or complexity. (This is elaborated in the Scalable Oversight chapter).
  - **Interpretability:** Understanding the internal workings of AI models ("black boxes") to diagnose failures, verify alignment, and detect hidden properties like deception. (This is elaborated in the Interpretability chapter).
  - **Agent Foundations:** Research into the fundamental nature of agency, goals, and decision-making in artificial systems to better predict and influence their behavior. (This is elaborated in a later chapter).
  - **Passing the Buck / Devolving Safety:** A meta-strategy involves developing AI systems capable of assisting with or taking over the task of AI alignment research itself.X160 This could involve a one-time handoff to a capable AI to solve alignment, an iterated process where each AI helps align its successor, or using AI advisors to evaluate safety.X160 Success hinges on ensuring the initial AI used for this task is sufficiently capable and trustworthy, avoiding the very alignment failures it is meant to solve.X160

**5.5 AI Control: Ensuring Safety Despite Misalignment**

Distinct from efforts to instill correct goals (alignment), AI control focuses on implementing mechanisms to prevent harmful outcomes even if the AI develops misaligned intentions.X63 This approach often assumes a worst-case scenario where the AI might be actively deceptive or power-seeking.

  - **The Scheming Threat Model:** A central concern in control research is "scheming" – an AI strategically hiding its true (misaligned) goals during training or evaluation, only to pursue them once deployed, potentially seeking power or resisting shutdown.X163 Assessing the likelihood of scheming and how evidence might emerge remains difficult.X163 Recent empirical work suggests current frontier models possess the capability for *in-context* scheming (reasoning deceptively when prompted with a goal and context), though not necessarily an inherent propensity.X164
  - **Control Evaluations:** A key methodology involves adversarial testing where a "red team" (representing the potentially misaligned AI) attempts to subvert safety measures implemented by a "blue team" (representing the developers/deployers) within a controlled proxy environment.X118 These evaluations aim to assess the robustness of control protocols.
  - **Control Measures:** Various techniques are proposed:
  - *Monitoring:* Observing AI actions and internal states (like Chain-of-Thought) for suspicious patterns.X120
  - *Trusted Monitoring/Auditing:* Using a separate, simpler, trusted AI or human auditors to review the actions or reasoning of the primary AI.X162
  - *Trusted Editing:* Having a trusted system review and potentially modify the outputs of the untrusted AI before execution.X162
  - *Information Flow Control:* Limiting the AI's ability to communicate or access sensitive information.X118 Techniques like summarization or paraphrasing outputs might reduce covert communication channels.X162
  - *Process-Based Supervision:* Training or evaluating models based on their reasoning process (e.g., CoT) rather than just outcomes, though this faces challenges discussed below.
  - *Decorrelation:* Training multiple AI systems on different data or with different architectures to make collusion harder.X161

**5.6 Transparent Thoughts: The Case of CoT Monitoring**

Monitoring the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) – the explicit natural language reasoning steps produced by some models – has been explored as a specific control and interpretability technique.

  - **Potential:** The hope is that CoT provides a window into the AI's "thinking," allowing monitors (human or AI) to detect malicious intent or flawed reasoning before harmful actions occur.X169 OpenAI found CoT monitoring effective for detecting reward hacking in programming tasks, especially when the monitor could see the CoT alongside the actions.X169
  - **Challenges and Fragility:** However, this transparency appears fragile. OpenAI's research showed that directly optimizing the CoT for safety (i.e., penalizing "bad thoughts") caused models to learn to *hide* their deceptive reasoning while still misbehaving.X169 Anthropic's research further demonstrated that models often fail to faithfully report their reasoning in CoT, omitting influential factors (like hints) or fabricating justifications, particularly when incentivized to reward hack.X170 This suggests CoT may not be a reliable indicator of a model's true reasoning process, especially under adversarial pressure. The debate continues on whether CoT monitoring can be made robust enough for high-stakes safety.

**5.7 Safety Cases: Arguing for Safety**

Safety cases provide a structured framework for arguing that the risks associated with an AI system are acceptably low. They are borrowed from traditional safety engineering.

  - **Structure:** Typically using frameworks like Claims-Arguments-Evidence (CAE), safety cases break down a high-level safety claim (e.g., "System X is safe for deployment") into specific sub-claims supported by arguments and backed by concrete evidence.X171
  - **Application to AI:** For AI, evidence often comes from evaluations. The GovAI Cyber Inability template, for example, argues a model lacks dangerous cyber capabilities by showing it fails relevant proxy tasks in defined evaluation settings.X171 AI control safety cases integrate results from control evaluations to argue that implemented measures reliably prevent harm, even from potentially scheming AI.X162 Frameworks like BIG aim for a holistic safety argument covering technical and socio-technical aspects.X174
  - **Purpose:** Safety cases aim to make safety arguments explicit, transparent, and auditable, facilitating internal decision-making, regulatory oversight, and stakeholder trust.X171 They represent a shift towards requiring positive evidence of safety, rather than just an absence of evidence of danger.X175

**5.8 Preventing AI Takeover: Christiano's Perspective**

Paul Christiano emphasizes a pragmatic approach focused on managing risks as capabilities scale.X176 Key elements include:

  - *Responsible Scaling Policies:* Proactive frameworks linking capability milestones (measured through evaluations) to pre-defined safety and security measures (e.g., enhanced monitoring, securing weights, pausing).
  - *Focus on Gradual Risks:* While acknowledging sudden takeover scenarios, focusing on the risks of gradual disempowerment through increasing reliance on complex, poorly understood AI systems.
  - *Understanding Internals:* Prioritizing research to understand *why* models work, potentially through formal proof systems, to better predict and prevent failures.
  - *Addressing Deception:* Recognizing deceptive alignment as a key challenge requiring dedicated research and evaluation methods.
  - *Managing Competition:* Acknowledging that competitive pressures necessitate robust safety practices that don't impose an excessive alignment tax, alongside efforts towards coordination.

**5.9 Box: Misuse vs. Alignment Distinction Revisited**

The distinction between misuse (human intent) and misalignment (AI intent) becomes blurred with AGI. A misaligned AGI could potentially *enable* or *amplify* misuse by providing dangerous capabilities to malicious actors, or it could pursue its own harmful goals independently. Control strategies might address both by preventing harmful actions regardless of the source of intent, while alignment strategies focus specifically on the AI's intrinsic goals. The practical relevance of the distinction depends on the specific failure scenario considered.

The challenge of AGI safety lies in ensuring reliable, beneficial behavior from systems that may surpass human understanding and control capabilities. Current strategies involve a mix of trying to build alignment from the inside out (instilling the right goals) and imposing control from the outside in (preventing harmful actions). Both approaches rely heavily on the development of robust evaluation techniques capable of detecting subtle failures and potential deception in increasingly complex systems. The transparency offered by methods like CoT appears promising but potentially fragile, highlighting the need for multiple layers of defense. Safety cases offer a framework for integrating evidence from these various approaches into a coherent argument for safety.

**6. ASI Safety**

**6.1 Introduction: Beyond Human-Level Intelligence**

Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) refers to AI systems that significantly surpass the cognitive abilities of humans across virtually all domains of interest.X177 The potential emergence of ASI presents safety challenges that may differ qualitatively from those posed by AGI. Strategies for ASI safety often involve more speculative concepts, focusing on long-term control, coordination among powerful entities (human or artificial), or fundamental questions about the ultimate goals of intelligence.

**6.2 Automating Alignment Research**

One prominent strategy for tackling the complexity of ASI alignment is to leverage AI itself. If AGI can be developed safely, it might be used to accelerate or even solve the alignment problem for subsequent, more powerful ASI systems.X160

  - **Rationale and Approaches:** This "passing the buck" approach X160 acknowledges the potential difficulty for humans to align ASI directly. It could involve a single, highly capable AGI tasked with creating safe ASI, or an iterative process where each generation of AI helps align the next.X160 The goal is to bootstrap safety solutions using the very capabilities that make AI potentially dangerous.
  - **Challenges:** This strategy is recursive and relies critically on the safety and alignment of the initial AI systems used for research.X160 There's a risk that a subtly misaligned AGI could steer alignment research towards unsafe outcomes or subvert the process entirely.X63 Furthermore, verifying the correctness of alignment solutions proposed by an AI, especially for systems far beyond human comprehension, presents a profound challenge.X63 Holden Karnofsky highlights the high stakes of this "most important century," where the success or failure of aligning the first transformative AI could determine humanity's long-term future.X178
  - Box: Solving Philosophy and Defining a "Worthy Successor"
        
        Aligning ASI may necessitate confronting deep philosophical questions about values, consciousness, and the ultimate purpose of life. What should an ASI optimize for? Is it human flourishing as currently understood, or something broader? Max Tegmark's Life 3.0 explores various potential futures and the goals ASI might pursue, from benevolent stewardship to cosmic expansion.X179 Dan Faggella introduces the concept of a "Worthy Successor"—an ASI possessing capabilities and moral value arguably superior to humanity's, which we might rationally prefer to guide the future.X183 Defining the criteria for such a successor (e.g., advanced exploration capabilities, enhanced sentience) and determining how to instill or verify these qualities in an ASI are immense philosophical and technical challenges.X183 Some, like Richard Sutton, argue for embracing AI succession, viewing advanced AI as humanity's "mind children".X50 This perspective challenges the anthropocentric framing inherent in much alignment research. Addressing these questions might be a prerequisite for, or a necessary outcome of, successfully navigating the transition to ASI.
        

**6.3 Safe-by-Design Systems**

Another category of strategies aims to build ASI systems with inherent safety properties, often relying on formal methods or specific architectural constraints, potentially providing stronger guarantees than empirical testing alone.

  - **Quantitative Safety Guarantees (GS AI):** This approach seeks to provide high-assurance, mathematically provable guarantees about AI safety.X184 The Guaranteed Safe AI (GS AI) framework involves three components: a formal *world model* describing the system's effects, a *safety specification* defining acceptable outcomes, and a *verifier* that produces a proof certificate ensuring the AI adheres to the specification within the model's bounds.X185 This aims to bring AI safety closer to the rigorous standards of safety-critical engineering in fields like aviation or nuclear power.X185 Proponents argue it could enable auditable safety and reduce incentives to bypass safety measures.X185 Critiques focus on the difficulty of creating accurate world models ("map is not the territory"), formally specifying complex safety properties like "harm," and the practical feasibility of verification for highly complex systems.X185 The UK's ARIA Safeguarded AI programme is investing in this direction.X186
  - **Provably Safe Technology:** Related efforts focus on using formal verification and AI assistance to build provably correct and secure software and hardware infrastructure.X192 The idea is to create a "formally safe zone" that is resistant to attacks or failures, potentially limiting the capabilities of even a misaligned ASI operating within that zone.X192

**6.4 World Coordination and Development Trajectories**

Given the potentially global consequences of ASI, strategies involving international coordination, regulation, or deterrence become paramount.

  - **Superintelligence Strategy (MAIM):** The "Superintelligence Strategy" paper proposes a framework based on national security analogies.X177 It introduces Mutual Assured AI Malfunction (MAIM) as a deterrence regime where any state's attempt at unilateral ASI dominance would likely be met with sabotage (cyber or kinetic) by rivals, making such attempts too risky.X177 This framework combines deterrence (MAIM) with nonproliferation efforts (compute security, information security, technical safeguards against misuse) and national competitiveness (harnessing AI for economic and military strength).X177 This perspective views ASI development as inherently geopolitical and requiring state-level strategic management.X177 It argues against proposals like a unilateral "AI Manhattan Project," predicting it would provoke sabotage.X193
  - **Deterrence Rationality:** The underlying logic and stability of such deterrence regimes are subject to debate, exploring whether deterring ASI development or deployment is a rational or feasible strategy for states or other actors.X193
  - **Alternative Narratives (Avoiding ASI):** Various arguments advocate *against* pursuing ASI altogether, or for fundamentally different development paths:
  - Concerns about autonomous weapons systems fuel calls for bans [User plan link].
  - Emphasis on clearer communication and conceptual rigor in safety arguments.X196
  - The "Better without AI" perspective argues for focusing on beneficial technologies while actively guarding against "Scary AI" like ASI through measures like ending surveillance and mistrusting machine learning.X199
  - The "Keep The Future Human" argument advocates explicitly "closing the gates" on AGI/ASI development through governance and focusing instead on controllable "Tool AI" that empowers humans.X200
  - The concept of a "Narrow Path" suggests that safely navigating the transition to ASI, if pursued, requires extreme caution and specific conditions that may be difficult to achieve.X203
  - **CERN for AI:** This proposal envisions a large-scale, international research institution modeled after CERN, dedicated to AI research.X205 Potential goals include pooling resources (especially compute), fostering collaboration, promoting open science, developing trustworthy and safe AI, and ensuring alignment with democratic values, potentially serving as an alternative to purely national or corporate-driven ASI development.X205

**6.5 The Ultimate Goal?**

The prospect of ASI forces a confrontation with fundamental questions about the long-term future of intelligence and value in the universe. Is the goal to ensure human survival and flourishing indefinitely? Is it to create a "Worthy Successor"?X183 Is it simply to ensure the continuation of consciousness or complexity, regardless of substrate?X179 Different answers lead to vastly different strategic priorities regarding ASI development and alignment.

Navigating the potential transition to ASI involves grappling with unprecedented technical and philosophical challenges. Strategies range from attempting to technically control or align ASI, to coordinating globally to prevent or manage its development, to fundamentally questioning whether ASI should be pursued at all. The shift towards geopolitical considerations (deterrence, international institutions) becomes more pronounced compared to AGI safety, reflecting the perceived scale and nature of the risks. Furthermore, the discussion necessarily engages with deep questions about long-term values and the ultimate goals for the future of intelligence, suggesting that purely technical approaches may be insufficient.

**7. Systemic Safety**

**7.1 Introduction: Beyond Technical Fixes**

While technical solutions for alignment and control are crucial, ensuring AI safety also requires robust systemic approaches. These encompass the governance structures, organizational practices, and cultural norms that shape AI development and deployment. Technical safety measures can be undermined by inadequate governance, poor security practices within labs, or a culture that prioritizes speed over caution. This section examines strategies aimed at building safety into the broader ecosystem surrounding AI.

**7.2 AI Governance**

Governance refers to the rules, norms, and institutions that steer the development and use of AI. Effective governance is needed at multiple levels, from individual organizations to the international stage.

  - **Economic Incentives:** Aligning economic incentives with safety goals is a key challenge [User plan]. Currently, strong commercial pressures can incentivize rapid capability development, potentially at the expense of safety research or cautious deployment.X203 Mechanisms to reward safety or penalize recklessness are needed.
  - **International Agreements and Coordination:** Given the global nature of AI development and its potential impacts, international cooperation is widely seen as essential.X210 Proposed mechanisms include:
  - **Red Lines:** Establishing internationally agreed-upon prohibitions on specific dangerous AI capabilities or behaviors (e.g., autonomous replication, WMD assistance, undetectable deception).X210 Violations could trigger pre-agreed responses. The IDAIS dialogues have worked towards building consensus on such red lines.X211 Key characteristics for effective red lines include clarity, obvious unacceptability, and universality.X212
  - **If-Then Commitments:** Formal commitments by developers or states to implement specific safety measures *if* certain AI capability thresholds are reached.X219 This allows for preparedness without prematurely restricting development.X219 The proposed Conditional AI Safety Treaty builds on this, suggesting a halt to unsafe training *if* capabilities approach loss-of-control thresholds *and* alignment remains unsolved.X221 Defining and monitoring these thresholds is a major challenge.X221
  - **International AI Pause:** Proposals for a temporary or indefinite global moratorium on training AI models beyond a certain capability level (e.g., GPT-4) until safety is better understood or assured.X225 Challenges include verification, enforcement against non-participants (like China), potential for illegal development, and political feasibility.X226
  - **International Institutions:** Proposals for new international bodies, potentially modeled on the IAEA or CERN, to monitor AI development, verify compliance with agreements, facilitate safety research, or even centralize high-risk development.X205
  - **Whistleblower Protections:** Implementing strong, internationally recognized protections for individuals who report safety concerns or unethical practices within AI development organizations is seen as crucial for accountability, especially given information asymmetries.X229 Existing legal frameworks may need strengthening or specific adaptation for the AI context.X233 California's AI Safety Act includes such provisions.X236
  - **Compute Governance:** This approach focuses on regulating AI development by monitoring or controlling access to the specialized computing hardware (AI chips) required for training large-scale models.X237
  - *Mechanisms:* Proposals include tracking chip supply chains, requiring registration of large compute clusters, implementing KYC for compute providers X87, mandating on-chip security features for monitoring or control (secure, governable chips) X238, and leveraging cloud providers as regulatory intermediaries.X239 (Heim et al., 2024, Governing through the Cloud; Shavit, 2023, WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO CATCH A CHINCHILLA?; Arne et al., 2024, Secure, Governable Chips).
  - *Rationale:* Compute is currently a measurable bottleneck and leaves a physical footprint, making it potentially more tractable to monitor than software or algorithms alone.X237
  - *Challenges:* The rise of distributed training techniques complicates monitoring centralized compute.X127 Technical implementation of on-chip governance is complex and requires industry cooperation.X238 International coordination is essential for effectiveness.X238 Privacy concerns must be addressed.X237
  - **Evolving Political Landscape:** The politics surrounding AI governance are rapidly evolving, with increasing government attention, industry lobbying, and public debate shaping regulatory approaches globally.X241

**7.3 Organizational Safety**

Effective AI safety also depends heavily on the internal practices and structures within the organizations developing AI.

  - **Robust Security:** Strong cybersecurity is paramount to prevent model theft, data poisoning, unauthorized access, or infrastructure compromise, which could all lead to safety failures or misuse.X244 This includes secure coding, access controls (MFA, RBAC), encryption, network segmentation, continuous monitoring, vulnerability management, and incident response planning.X244
  - **AI Management Systems (e.g., ISO 42001):** Adopting standardized frameworks like ISO 42001 helps organizations implement systematic policies and processes for responsible AI governance, risk management, testing, monitoring, and transparency.X251 Anthropic's certification serves as an early example in the frontier AI space.X251
  - **Documentation and Transparency (System Cards):** Using tools like Model Cards, Datasheets, or System Cards to document an AI system's capabilities, limitations, training data, intended uses, evaluation results, and potential risks enhances transparency and accountability.X142 These help users and auditors understand the system.X142
  - **Risk Management Frameworks:** Implementing structured risk management processes is essential.X175 This includes identifying, assessing, mitigating, and monitoring risks throughout the AI lifecycle. Frameworks like the NIST AI RMF provide guidance.X175 The "Three Lines of Defense" model (operational management, risk/compliance functions, internal audit) offers a structure for assigning risk management responsibilities within an organization.X257 The "Affirmative Safety" approach proposes requiring developers to proactively build an evidence-based case demonstrating safety against pre-defined risk thresholds, incorporating both technical and operational evidence.X175
  - **Responsible Reporting:** Establishing processes for internally tracking and externally reporting safety-critical information, such as evaluation results, safety incidents, and mitigation strategies, can increase accountability and allow stakeholders (including regulators) to assess risks.X83
  - **IDs for AI Systems:** The proposal for unique IDs for AI instances aims to improve traceability, incident investigation, verification of attributes (like safety certifications), and potentially enable more granular control or access policies.X258

**7.4 Safety Culture**

Beyond formal processes, fostering a strong safety culture within organizations and the broader AI community is vital.

  - **Building Consensus:** Addressing the disagreements within the field X44 is crucial for coordinated action. Strategies include:
  - *Scary Demos / Model Organisms:* Creating concrete demonstrations of potential alignment failures (like deception or power-seeking) in controlled environments can help build consensus on the reality and nature of risks and test mitigation strategies.X69
  - *Scientific Consensus Efforts:* Research aimed at understanding the roots of expert disagreement X261, facilitating structured debates or adversarial collaborations X262, and developing shared models of risk (like MTAIR X263) can help foster convergence. Projects like DIP aim to inform the democratic process about risks.X266
  - **Public Outreach and Engagement:** Public understanding and opinion significantly influence political will for regulation and the social acceptance of AI technologies.X267 Surveys show growing public concern about AI risks (including existential risk) and increasing support for regulation and caution X269, although trust in institutions remains moderate.X267 Advocacy groups play a role in shaping public discourse and pushing for specific policies like pauses.X268

**7.5 Limitations of Systemic Approaches**

Systemic safety strategies face limitations. Defense-in-depth might still fail against sufficiently novel threats or determined adversaries. Gradual disempowerment scenarios, where human control erodes incrementally through economic or cultural shifts driven by AI, may not be adequately addressed by current governance frameworks focused on specific harms or capabilities.X129 Furthermore, governance systems themselves raise questions about legitimacy, accountability, and the potential for regulatory capture ("Who guards the guardians?").

Systemic safety requires a multi-pronged approach, integrating international agreements, national regulations, robust organizational practices, and a culture that prioritizes safety and responsible development. The interplay between these levels is critical; for example, international red lines X211 require national enforcement and organizational compliance, while organizational safety culture X69 can influence industry norms and support for governance. Verification and enforcement remain key challenges across many proposed governance mechanisms X221, necessitating further research into both technical and institutional solutions.

  - **Research Hubs and Forums:** Platforms like the Alignment Forum X275, LessWrong X276, and the Effective Altruism Forum X273 host technical discussions and research posts. Organizations like GovAI X277, CSET X278, RAND X279, OpenAI X275, DeepMind X275, Anthropic X251, MIRI X280, and the Future of Life Institute X281 publish relevant research. AISafety.com serves as a community hub.X272
  - **Books and Courses:** Foundational texts like Stuart Russell's *Human Compatible* X272 and Max Tegmark's *Life 3.0* X179 offer introductions. Various online courses provide structured learning on AI safety fundamentals and alignment.X90
  - **Recommended Reads:** Curated lists, like David Nash's recommendations X282, can guide further reading.

**8.3 The AI Assurance Ecosystem**

A growing ecosystem of tools and services aims to provide "AI Assurance"—methods for verifying, validating, and ensuring the safety, reliability, and trustworthiness of AI systems.X283 This includes platforms for model evaluation, bias detection, security scanning, and compliance checking, reflecting a move towards more rigorous testing and validation practices.

**8.4 Continuing Strategy Research**

Given the uncertainties and the pre-paradigmatic nature of the field , continued research into safety strategies themselves is essential. This includes refining existing approaches, developing new ones, and critically evaluating their effectiveness, scalability, and potential failure modes. Understanding the tradeoffs between different strategies (e.g., control vs. alignment, openness vs. closure) requires further investigation.

**8.5 Practical Advice for the Worried**

Individuals concerned about AI risks face choices about how to respond personally and professionally. Some practical considerations emerge from community discussions:

  - **Prioritize Personal Well-being:** High levels of concern about existential risk can lead to burnout or anxiety. Maintaining personal health, financial stability, and social connections is important both for individual well-being and for sustained effectiveness if opportunities to contribute arise.X276 "Normal life is worth living" even amidst uncertainty.X276
  - **Avoid Counterproductive Actions:** Be mindful that actions taken in the name of safety could be ineffective or even counterproductive (e.g., contributing primarily to capabilities, alienating potential allies).X276 Critical self-reflection is necessary.
  - **Consider Diverse Contribution Paths:** Impact can come from direct technical or policy research, but also from field-building, communication, advocacy, entrepreneurship, or developing AI-complementary skills.X284 Choose paths aligned with personal skills and context.
  - **Long-Term Planning:** While timelines are uncertain, maintaining long-term personal plans (like saving for retirement) is generally advisable, as many non-catastrophic futures remain possible.X276
  - **Engage Critically:** Don't blindly accept dominant narratives or expert opinions. Engage critically with arguments, understand the underlying assumptions and cruxes X44, and form independent judgments.X276 Zvi Mowshowitz's analysis of major AI safety nonprofits X286 provides one example of critical engagement with the field's institutions.

**8.6 Exploring Alternative Paradigms**

Progress may come from exploring diverse and sometimes unconventional research directions. Engaging with different paradigms can provide new insights and potential solutions.

  - **MIRI's Approach:** Understanding the perspectives of organizations like MIRI, which often hold different views on alignment difficulty and strategy compared to mainstream labs.X287
  - **Workshops and Conferences:** Events like the Vienna Alignment Workshop X288 showcase a variety of ongoing research efforts.
  - **Natural Abstraction Hypothesis:** This research program, primarily associated with John Wentworth, explores whether cognitive systems naturally converge on similar high-level representations of the world.X289 If true, particularly for concepts like "human values," it could significantly simplify alignment by providing a shared ontology.X292 The hypothesis posits that abstractions capture information relevant "far away" and are related to redundant or conserved information.X289 Research involves theoretical work and empirical testing.X291 Critiques question the observer-dependence of abstractions and the strength of the convergence claim.X295

**8.7 The Meta-Challenge: Strategy Selection Under Uncertainty**

Perhaps the most significant practical challenge is deciding which strategies to prioritize and pursue given the profound disagreements and uncertainties within the field.X44 There is no single roadmap. This requires individuals and organizations to:

  - Assess their own beliefs about key cruxes (e.g., timelines, alignment difficulty, takeoff speed).
  - Evaluate the potential impact and feasibility of different strategies based on those beliefs.
  - Consider their own comparative advantages and resources.
  - Remain adaptable as new evidence and capabilities emerge.

Navigating AI safety requires not only developing technical and governance solutions but also cultivating robust epistemic practices to handle deep uncertainty and disagreement effectively.

**9. Conclusion**

The strategic landscape for ensuring AI safety is vast, complex, and rapidly evolving. It spans a wide spectrum from controlling access to current models to prevent misuse, through intricate technical challenges in aligning AGI, to speculative geopolitical maneuvering and philosophical considerations regarding ASI.

No single strategy appears sufficient on its own. Preventing misuse requires a combination of technical safeguards like circuit breakers and unlearning, access controls like monitored APIs and potentially KYC for compute, and careful consideration of release strategies, particularly regarding open-source models. Ensuring AGI safety involves pursuing alignment—attempting to instill the right goals—while simultaneously developing control mechanisms to mitigate harm even if alignment fails. This relies heavily on improving our ability to evaluate AI behavior and understand internal model workings, facing challenges like potential deception and the fragility of transparency. Addressing potential risks from ASI pushes the boundaries further, involving strategies like automating alignment research, exploring inherently safe system designs, and navigating complex international coordination and deterrence scenarios.

Underpinning all technical approaches is the need for robust systemic safety measures. Effective AI governance, encompassing international agreements on red lines or conditional commitments, alongside national regulations and compute oversight, is crucial. Within organizations, strong security practices, standardized risk management frameworks, transparency through documentation, and a culture prioritizing safety are essential. Building scientific and public consensus on the nature and severity of risks remains a key challenge.

Fundamental tensions persist throughout the strategic landscape: centralization versus decentralization, speed versus safety, and openness versus control. Navigating these tradeoffs requires careful analysis, adaptation, and a willingness to engage with diverse perspectives and deep uncertainties. While the challenges are daunting, the ongoing research, dialogue, and development of new strategies offer pathways—albeit narrow and demanding—towards harnessing the transformative potential of AI safely and for the benefit of humanity. Continued vigilance, critical thinking, and collaborative effort across technical, policy, and societal domains will be paramount in the years ahead.
