## **Beyond the Scope of This Chapter**

While this chapter focuses on strategies directly related to preventing large-scale negative outcomes from AI misuse, misalignment, or uncontrolled development, several related topics are necessarily placed beyond its primary scope to maintain clarity and focus. Several issues are treated as distinct domains and are not the central focus here:

- **AI-Generated Misinformation:** The proliferation of AI-driven misinformation, including deepfakes and biased content generation. Strategies to combat this, such as robust detection systems, watermarking, and responsible AI principles, are beyond the score of the chapter. These often fall under the umbrella of content moderation, media literacy, and platform governance, distinct from the core technical alignment and control strategies discussed in this chapter.
- **Standard Privacy and Security:** AI systems often process vast amounts of data, amplifying existing concerns about data privacy and cybersecurity.X6 Standard security practices like encryption, access control, data classification, threat monitoring, and anonymization are prerequisites for safe AI deployment.X7 While foundational, these standard practices are distinct from the novel safety strategies needed to address risks like model misalignment or capability misuse, although robust security is vital for measures like protecting model weights.
- **Discrimination and Toxicity:** While biased or toxic outputs constitute a safety concern, this chapter concentrates on strategies aimed at preventing catastrophic failures or misuse stemming from advanced capabilities or goal misalignment, rather than the pervasive issue of bias itself.
- **Negative Externalities (Socioeconomic, Environmental):** The development and deployment of AI have significant externalities, including potential job displacement X16, increased economic inequality X17, substantial energy and water consumption by data centers X18, reliance on unsustainably mined minerals X18, and a considerable carbon footprint.X19 These raise concerns about digital colonialism and sustainability.X19 While critical for overall societal well-being and requiring governance solutions X21, these externalities are generally considered distinct from the technical safety challenges of controlling advanced AI behavior, and while summarily treated in the systemic risks section, wonâ€™t be really detailed.
- **AI Welfare and Rights:** As AI systems become more sophisticated, questions arise about their potential for sentience and the ethical considerations regarding their treatment.X15 This is a distinct ethical domain concerning our obligations *to* AI, rather than ensuring safety *from* AI.
- **Devaluation of Human Effort:** The potential for AI to diminish the perceived value of human creativity and labor is a significant socioeconomic and psychological concern X14, but not a direct technical safety strategy.
- **Errors due to lack of Capability:** While AI system failures due to lack of capability or capability or robustness are a source of risk X38, the strategies discussed in this chapter are aimed at *mitigating* risks arising from *both* insufficient robustness *and* potentially high (but misaligned or misused) capabilities. And the solutions to this type of risk are the same as for other industries: testing, iteration, and making the system more capable.

The scope chosen here reflects a common focus within certain parts of the AI safety community on existential or large-scale catastrophic risks arising from powerful, potentially agentic AI systems.

A common distinction is made between near-term AI safety concerns (often related to current systems, addressing issues like bias, fairness, privacy, transparency, and immediate misuse) and long-term or existential safety concerns (focused on risks from future, highly capable AGI or ASI, such as loss of control or catastrophic misalignment).X75 This chapter primarily focuses on strategies relevant to the latter, though the boundary can be blurry.
